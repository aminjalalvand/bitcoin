Value added tax -- a type of sales levy -- needn't be applied because the business involves "the exchange of different means of payment," the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled Thursday.</p><img src="http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iHJOo8eUsL10/v1/-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Some technology even completely 'disrupts' whole industries as you'll see below. Some people push back against it. That's happened through all of human history. The trick is to embrace, work with and understand the technology. Right now you're seeing tangible change in major industry from taxi's (Uber) to media (Netflix).</p><img src="http://www.dailyreckoning.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/banks_6002.jpg"></article>]]></description>
